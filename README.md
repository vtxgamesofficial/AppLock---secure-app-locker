# AppLock - Secure App Locker (𝓩𝖍𝖓𝖖𝖗)

AppLock is a small Android project I built to lock apps in a way that’s actually fun.
It keeps people out of your apps, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously.

Think of it as part productivity tool, part harmless chaos.

## Features

- Lock specific apps or all apps
  Choose exactly which apps to protect. Social media, messages, gallery — whatever you want. Or just lock everything.

- Meme lock screen
  Instead of a boring "Access Denied" screen, random memes show up when someone tries to open a locked app.
  If someone’s snooping, they might as well get roasted.

- Persistent after restart
  Restarting your phone won’t disable the lock.

- Secret code to disable
  To turn off the service or unlock everything, use the default code:
  cba

- Dark neon style
  Clean black theme with a neon shield look. Simple and minimal.
